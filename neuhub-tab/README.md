### Credits

This theme uses the Tabler UI Kit, which can be found at [https://tabler.io](https://tabler.io)

I studied the themes from [https://github.com/DeadSuperHero/hubzilla-themes](https://github.com/DeadSuperHero/hubzilla-themes) and used their structure as a model. 

And, of course, this theme references code from the Redbasic theme located at: [https://framagit.org/hubzilla/core](https://framagit.org/hubzilla/core)
